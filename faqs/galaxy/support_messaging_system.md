### Introduction

The Galaxy community uses [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) ‚Äì a secure, decentralized, open-source messaging protocol ‚Äì as its primary chat system. Matrix enables real-time communication across Galaxy contributors, developers, trainers, and users. Common uses include:

* Getting help from the community
* Discussing tool and workflow development
* Organizing training events and materials
* Collaborating on Galaxy infrastructure or scientific questions

Matrix provides an open alternative to proprietary platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams, with broader flexibility and user privacy in mind.

### üî∞ For Newbies: Getting Started with Matrix

If you are new to messaging systems, here's how to get started with Galaxy on Matrix:

#### Step 1: Choose and install a Matrix app

**Install a Matrix client app:** Download and install a Matrix client:

* [**Element**](https://element.io/) ‚Äì Recommended. Available on [Web](https://app.element.io), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/element/id1083446067), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app), [Windows/macOS/Linux](https://element.io/download).&#x20;

* [**Cinny**](https://cinny.in/)

* [**Other Matrix clients...**](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/)

All of these apps connect to the same Galaxy channels/rooms. Choose the interface that works best for you.

#### Step 2: Create a Matrix account

* Open the app and sign up. It's easiest to use the default public server at `matrix.org` for your account.
* Choose a username. Your Matrix ID will look like: `@yourname:matrix.org`.

#### Step 3: Join the Galaxy **"Lobby"**

* In your Matrix client, join the [main Galaxy chat room - The Lobby](https://matrix.to/#/#galaxyproject_Lobby:gitter.im).
  * If you're using the Element client, click Explore (the compass icon) and search for "Galaxy" ‚Äì look for a room named Galaxy or Galaxy Lobby (often with an address like `#galaxyproject:matrix.org`).
  * Alternatively, you can use a direct Matrix link if provided, which will prompt your app to join the room.

* In addition to the [Lobby room](https://matrix.to/#/#galaxyproject_Lobby:gitter.im), join other Matrix rooms via direct links once logged in:

      <tr>
        <th>Galaxy Subjects on Matrix:</th>
        <th>Galaxy Users on Matrix:</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

          <strong><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#galaxyproject:matrix.org" >All Galaxy Matrix rooms, 70+ rooms</a></strong>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

</div>

**Say hello and ask questions:** Once in the Galaxy Lobby, feel free to introduce yourself or ask your question. This Lobby room is a friendly starting point ‚Äì community members will welcome you, answer basic questions, and guide you to more specific Galaxy channels/rooms if needed. You will be redirected to the right room if needed.

### üí° For Experienced Users (Slack/Teams/Discord Users)

If you've used tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Discord, Matrix will feel familiar ‚Äî with a few important differences:

#### ‚úÖ Key Similarities

* **Rooms ‚âà Channels**: Rooms are topic-based, like Slack channels.
* **DMs supported**: You can message users privately.
* **Multiple devices**: Stay logged in on phone, tablet, laptop.

#### ‚ùó Key Differences

* **Federated, decentralized network**: There is no single ‚ÄúGalaxy workspace‚Äù to be invited to. Join any Matrix room directly via a public server.
* **Flexible clients**: You can use different Matrix client apps across platforms. They all show the same chats.
* **Room discovery**: Galaxy may provide a **Matrix Space** to group related rooms to organize communities (e.g. training, user help, development, working groups/wg, infrastructure).
* **Bridged rooms**: Some rooms are connected to Gitter or other services, but behave normally in Matrix. For example:

  ```
  #galaxyproject_Lobby:gitter.im
  ```

  This is a Matrix room that also syncs with users on Gitter. You can treat them as normal Matrix rooms; messages are synced across the platforms.

### üîê Security and Privacy

Matrix supports **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)** in private conversations and invite-only rooms.

However, **public Galaxy rooms are not encrypted**. This is intentional so people can easily join and search history. Therefore:

* üîç **Assume public visibility**: Don't share passwords, private research data, or anything sensitive.
* üôà **Use nicknames if preferred**: Your Matrix ID is visible in public rooms, but you don't have to use your real name.
* üîê **Private DMs are encrypted by default**.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Be cautious**: Even with encryption, nothing is foolproof. Use common sense.

Matrix is designed for open collaboration. When in doubt, treat public rooms like an open forum.

---

### üìç TL;DR Quickstart

* ‚úÖ Install [Element](https://element.io) or another Matrix app
* ‚úÖ Create an account (Matrix ID)
* ‚úÖ Join `#galaxyproject:matrix.org` (Galaxy Lobby)
* ‚úÖ Ask questions or join other Galaxy rooms from there
* ‚ùå Don't share private info in public rooms
