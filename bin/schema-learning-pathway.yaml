            `admin-dev`
            :  should be used for admin and developer topics that are not scientifically focused.

            `basics`

            `data-science`
            :  Topics which are not necessarily Galaxy focused but expand into broader communities

            `use`
            :  These topics use galaxy for some analysis

            is useful if you need an LP for a workshop, but have not
            finished making it up to GTN standards.

                      List of Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) learning objectives for the tutorial

                      A learning objective is a single sentence describing what a learner will be able to do once they have done the tutorial. Generally it is best to follow a 2C or 3C learning objective such as:

                      - Compute (Skill)
                      - multiple whole genome assemblies (Objective)
                      - in such a way to develop big data processing skills (Result)
                  _examples:
                      - Understand the basic concepts behind phylogenetic trees, as applied to *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*
                      - Explore Biodiversity data with taxonomic, temporal and geographical informations
                      - Generate a DotPlot emulating the original paper using a different analysis tool
